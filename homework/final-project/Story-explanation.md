I'd like to look into whether more organizations are looking to hire IT specialists to protect them from cybersecurity breaches. I read an article that said that companies should be/are investing more in their IT departments for this reason.

So I was thinking that it might be interesting to go through the Jobs website that we used previously to see if there was an uptick in these types of jobs and if so, analyse it across time/industry. And I figure that even if there isn't an uptick, that might be a story in itself.
