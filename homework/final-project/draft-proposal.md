Cybersecurity is not a new concern. In 2003, California became the first state in the country to require data breach notifications. And as of 2012, companies and government agencies subject to California law have been required to submit copies of their data breach notices to the Attorney General if the breach involves more than 500 Californians.

Earlier this quarter, I focused on California data breaches for a story I did for Cheryl. But of course, this is much larger issue and affects the nation, which is why I’d like to focus on it for my final project.

Thanks for the U.S. Cert idea, it looks like a really great resource and a potential goldmine for stories. As you suggested, I’ll start by scraping all the information (they have weekly updates on security breaches that go back to 2010, which is a whole lot of information).

Then, once I have all the information, I’d like to look for potential story ideas by writing scripts similar to the ones we wrote for the White House Briefings exercise. So, for example, I could search for the vendors that have been breached the most over time, or sort them by vulnerability.

I think it would also be really useful to try to create a search tool for people. So I could scrape all the data and then make it easy for people to do text searches for specific vendors that they may be interested in knowing about. This could save someone a lot of time since they wouldn’t have to manually go through every week of every year.

The Cert bullitins are available here: https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/bulletins and will be my primary source. Then, once I identify some trends, I can do further research or speak to sources I have already reached out to for previous stories.
